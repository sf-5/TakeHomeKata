# Random Quiz App
Users can take quizzes pulled from an API, with a category, difficulty, and length of their choosing. Users can also create and share quizzes. Type in the friend code "1" to see an example quiz I created with this tool. Navigate to the directory that flask_main.py is located in. Type `flask --app flask_main run` and the application should run on a local port.
